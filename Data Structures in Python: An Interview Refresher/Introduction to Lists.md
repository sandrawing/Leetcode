The time complexity of each of these operations is the asymptotic average case taken from the Python Wiki page.

The insert() function

Inserts element to the list. Use it like list.insert(index, value). It works in O(n) time.

The remove() function

Removes the given element at a given index. Use it like list.remove(element). It works in O(n) time. 
If the element does not exist, you will get a runtime error.
