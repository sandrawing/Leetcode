Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

Approach 2: HashMap

```ruby
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        counts = collections.Counter(nums)
        return max(counts.keys(), key=counts.get)
```

Call max(iterable, key=dict.get) with the same dictionary as both iterable and dict to find the key paired with the max value.

```ruby
a_dictionary = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

max_key = max(a_dictionary, key=a_dictionary.get)
```

Approach 3: Sorting

```ruby
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums)//2]
```
