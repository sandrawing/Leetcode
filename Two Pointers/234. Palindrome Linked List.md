Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Solution from Educative.io

Solution #
As we know, a palindrome LinkedList will have nodes values that read the same backward or forward. This means that if we divide the LinkedList into two halves, the node values of the first half in the forward direction should be similar to the node values of the second half in the backward direction. As we have been given a Singly LinkedList, we can’t move in the backward direction. To handle this, we will perform the following steps:

We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.
Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half.
Then, we will compare the first half with the reversed second half to see if the LinkedList represents a palindrome.
Finally, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList again to revert and bring the LinkedList back to its original form.

```ruby
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return True

        # find middle of the LinkedList
        slow, fast = head, head
        while (fast is not None and fast.next is not None):
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        head_second_half = self.reverse(slow)  # reverse the second half
        # store the head of reversed part to revert back later
        copy_head_second_half = head_second_half

        # compare the first and the second half
        while (head is not None and head_second_half is not None):
            if head.val != head_second_half.val:
                break  # not a palindrome

            head = head.next
            head_second_half = head_second_half.next

        self.reverse(copy_head_second_half)  # revert the reverse of the second half

        if head is None or head_second_half is None:  # if both halves match
            return True

        return False


    def reverse(self, head):
        prev = None
        while (head is not None):
            next = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = next
        return prev
```

Time complexity #
The above algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

Approach 1: Copy into Array List and then Use Two Pointer Technique

```ruby
def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
    vals = []
    current_node = head
    while current_node is not None:
        vals.append(current_node.val)
        current_node = current_node.next
    return vals == vals[::-1]
```
