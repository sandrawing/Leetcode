Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

```ruby
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        start, end = 0, len(numbers)-1
        while start != end:
            if numbers[start] + numbers[end] == target:
                return [start+1, end+1]
            elif numbers[start] + numbers[end] < target:
                start += 1
            else:
                end -= 1
```
