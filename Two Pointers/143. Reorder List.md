Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

My answer:

```ruby
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        median = self.find_median(head)
        head_second_half = self.reverse(median)
        # while head.next is not median:
        while head_second_half != None and head_second_half.next != None:
            temp1 = head.next
            temp2 = head_second_half.next
            head.next = head_second_half
            head_second_half.next = temp1
            head = temp1
            head_second_half = temp2
    
    def find_median(self, head):
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast != None and fast.next != None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = (fast.next).next
        return slow
    
    def reverse(self, head):
        prev = None
        while (head is not None):
            next = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = next
        return prev
```

```ruby
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        if not head:
            return 
        
        # find the middle of linked list [Problem 876]
        # in 1->2->3->4->5->6 find 4 
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next 
            
        # reverse the second part of the list [Problem 206]
        # convert 1->2->3->4->5->6 into 1->2->3->4 and 6->5->4
        # reverse the second half in-place
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            curr.next, prev, curr = prev, curr, curr.next       

        # merge two sorted linked lists [Problem 21]
        # merge 1->2->3->4 and 6->5->4 into 1->6->2->5->3->4
        first, second = head, prev
        while second.next:
            first.next, first = second, first.next
            second.next, second = first, second.next
```

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(N). There are three steps here. To identify the middle node takes O(N) time. To reverse the second part of the list, one needs N/2N/2 operations. The final step, to merge two lists, requires N/2N/2 operations as well. In total, that results in \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) time complexity.

Space complexity: O(1), since we do not allocate any additional data structures.


Solution from Educative.io

This problem shares similarities with Palindrome LinkedList. To rearrange the given LinkedList we will follow the following steps:

We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.

Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.

Finally, we’ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the required order.

```ruby
from __future__ import print_function


class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, next=None):
    self.value = value
    self.next = next

  def print_list(self):
    temp = self
    while temp is not None:
      print(str(temp.value) + " ", end='')
      temp = temp.next
    print()


def reorder(head):
  if head is None or head.next is None:
    return

  # find middle of the LinkedList
  slow, fast = head, head
  while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

  # slow is now pointing to the middle node
  head_second_half = reverse(slow)  # reverse the second half
  head_first_half = head

  # rearrange to produce the LinkedList in the required order
  while head_first_half is not None and head_second_half is not None:
    temp = head_first_half.next
    head_first_half.next = head_second_half
    head_first_half = temp

    temp = head_second_half.next
    head_second_half.next = head_first_half
    head_second_half = temp

  # set the next of the last node to 'None'
  if head_first_half is not None:
    head_first_half.next = None


def reverse(head):
  prev = None
  while head is not None:
    next = head.next
    head.next = prev
    prev = head
    head = next
  return prev


def main():
  head = Node(2)
  head.next = Node(4)
  head.next.next = Node(6)
  head.next.next.next = Node(8)
  head.next.next.next.next = Node(10)
  head.next.next.next.next.next = Node(12)
  reorder(head)
  head.print_list()


main()
```
