Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Solution from Leetcode

Approach #1: Build String

ntuition

Let's individually build the result of each string (build(S) and build(T)), then compare if they are equal.

Algorithm

To build the result of a string build(S), we'll use a stack based approach, simulating the result of each keystroke.

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        def build(S):
            ans = []
            for c in S:
                if c != '#':
                    ans.append(c)
                elif ans:
                    ans.pop()
            return "".join(ans)
        return build(S) == build(T)
```

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(M + N), where M, N are the lengths of S and T respectively.

Space Complexity: O(M + N).
