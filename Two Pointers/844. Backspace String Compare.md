Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Solution from Leetcode

Approach #1: Build String

ntuition

Let's individually build the result of each string (build(S) and build(T)), then compare if they are equal.

Algorithm

To build the result of a string build(S), we'll use a stack based approach, simulating the result of each keystroke.

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        def build(S):
            ans = []
            for c in S:
                if c != '#':
                    ans.append(c)
                elif ans:
                    ans.pop()
            return "".join(ans)
        return build(S) == build(T)
```

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(M + N), where M, N are the lengths of S and T respectively.

Space Complexity: O(M + N).

Python pop()

```ruby
# programming languages list
languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Ruby', 'C']

# remove and return the last item
print('When index is not passed:') 
print('Return Value:', languages.pop())
print('Updated List:', languages)

# remove and return the last item
print('\nWhen -1 is passed:') 
print('Return Value:', languages.pop(-1))
print('Updated List:', languages)

# remove and return the third last item
print('\nWhen -3 is passed:') 
print('Return Value:', languages.pop(-3))
print('Updated List:', languages)
```

The output
```ruby
When index is not passed:
Return Value: C
Updated List: ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Ruby']

When -1 is passed:
Return Value: Ruby
Updated List: ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']

When -3 is passed:
Return Value: Python
Updated List: ['Java', 'C++']
```

Approach #2: Two Pointer

Intuition

When writing a character, it may or may not be part of the final string depending on how many backspace keystrokes occur in the future.

If instead we iterate through the string in reverse, then we will know how many backspace characters we have seen, and therefore whether the result includes our character.

Algorithm

Iterate through the string in reverse. If we see a backspace character, the next non-backspace character is skipped. If a character isn't skipped, it is part of the final answer.

See the comments in the code for more details.

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        """
        :type S: str
        :type T: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def F(S):
            skip = 0
            for x in reversed(S):
                if x == '#':
                    skip += 1
                elif skip:
                    skip -= 1
                else:
                    yield x

        return all(x == y for x, y in itertools.izip_longest(F(S), F(T)))
```
