Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

My answer

```ruby
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def middleNode(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast != None and fast.next != None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = (fast.next).next
        return slow
```

Time complexity #
The above algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
