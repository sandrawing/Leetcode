Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

```ruby
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dict1 = {}
        for i, j in enumerate(nums):
            if target - j in dict1:
                return [dict1[target-j], i]
            else:
                dict1[j] = i
```
