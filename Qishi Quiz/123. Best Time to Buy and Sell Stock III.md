Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

This method can be extended to solve the maximum profit problem with multiple transactions

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        t1_cost, t2_cost, t3_cost = float('inf'), float('inf'), float('inf')
        t1_profit, t2_profit, t3_profit = 0, 0, 0

        for price in prices:
            t1_cost = min(t1_cost, price)
            t1_profit = max(t1_profit, price - t1_cost)
            t2_cost = min(t2_cost, price - t1_profit)
            t2_profit = max(t2_profit, price - t2_cost)
            t3_cost = min(t3_cost, price - t2_profit)
            t3_profit = max(t3_profit, price - t3_cost)

        return t3_profit
```
