Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

My answer

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if k == 0:
            return 0
        
        costs = [float('inf')] * k
        profits = [0] * k

        for price in prices:
            for i in range(k):
                if i == 0:
                    costs[i] = min(costs[i], price)
                else:
                    costs[i] = min(costs[i], price - profits[i-1])
                profits[i] = max(profits[i], price - costs[i])

        return profits[-1]
```

    def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if k <= 0 or len(prices) <= 1:
            return 0
        if k >= len(prices) / 2:
            gain = 0
            for i in range(1, len(prices)):
                gain += max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1])
            return gain
        
        costs = [float('inf')] * k
        profits = [0] * k

        for price in prices:
            for i in range(k):
                if i == 0:
                    costs[i] = min(costs[i], price)
                else:
                    costs[i] = min(costs[i], price - profits[i-1])
                profits[i] = max(profits[i], price - costs[i])

        return profits[-1]
```
