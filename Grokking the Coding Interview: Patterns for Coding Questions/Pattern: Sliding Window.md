The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each contiguous subarray as a sliding window of ‘5’ elements. This means that when we move on to the next subarray, we will slide the window by one element. So, to reuse the sum from the previous subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window and add the element now being included in the sliding window. This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to O(N).


Problem 1

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.

1. My solution

``ruby
def max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr):
  max_sum = 0
  for i in range(len(arr) - k):
    max_sum = max(max_sum, sum(arr[i:i+k]))
  return max_sum
``

2. Answer

``ruby
def max_sub_array_of_size_k(k, arr):
  max_sum , window_sum = 0, 0
  window_start = 0

  for window_end in range(len(arr)):
    window_sum += arr[window_end]  # add the next element
    # slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
    if window_end >= k-1:
      max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
      window_sum -= arr[window_start]  # subtract the element going out
      window_start += 1  # slide the window ahead
  return max_sum


def main():
  print("Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: " + str(max_sub_array_of_size_k(3, [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2])))
  print("Maximum sum of a subarray of size K: " + str(max_sub_array_of_size_k(2, [2, 3, 4, 1, 5])))

main()
```
