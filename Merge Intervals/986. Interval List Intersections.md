Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(M + N), where M, N are the lengths of A and B respectively.

Space Complexity: O(M + N), the maximum size of the answer.

      j += 1

  return result


def main():
  print("Intervals Intersection: " + str(merge([[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], [[2, 3], [5, 7]])))
  print("Intervals Intersection: " + str(merge([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]], [[5, 10]])))

Time complexity #
As we are iterating through both the lists once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N + M), where ‘N’ and ‘M’ are the total number of intervals in the input arrays respectively.

Space complexity #
Ignoring the space needed for the result list, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
