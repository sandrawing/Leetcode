We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

Answer:

```ruby
"""
# Definition for an Interval.
class Interval:
    def __init__(self, start: int = None, end: int = None):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
"""
from heapq import *


class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: '[[Interval]]') -> '[Interval]':
        if schedule is None:
            return []
        n = len(schedule)
        result, minHeap = [], []
        for i in range(n):
            heappush(minHeap, [schedule[i][0].start, schedule[i][0].end, 0, i])
        previousInterval = minHeap[0]
        while minHeap:
            queueTop = heappop(minHeap)
            if previousInterval[1] < queueTop[0]:
                result.append(Interval(previousInterval[1], queueTop[0]))
                previousInterval = queueTop
            else:
                if previousInterval[1] < queueTop[1]:
                    previousInterval = queueTop
            
            # 要记录一下每个输入进去的Interval所在的整个schedule中的位置，以及在自己的这个list中的位置
            employeeSchedule = schedule[queueTop[3]]
            if len(employeeSchedule) > queueTop[2] + 1:
                heappush(minHeap, [employeeSchedule[queueTop[2] + 1].start, employeeSchedule[queueTop[2] + 1].end, queueTop[2] + 1, queueTop[3]])
        
        return result
```

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logK), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals and ‘K’ is the total number of employees. This is due to the fact that we are iterating through the intervals only once (which will take O(N)), and every time we process an interval, we remove (and can insert) one interval in the Min Heap, (which will take O(logK)). At any time the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K) as at any time the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.
