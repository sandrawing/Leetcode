Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :type newInterval: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        merged = []
        i, start, end = 0, 0, 1

        # skip (and add to output) all intervals that come before the 'new_interval'
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][end] < newInterval[start]:
            merged.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1

        # merge all intervals that overlap with 'new_interval'
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][start] <= newInterval[end]:
            newInterval[start] = min(intervals[i][start], newInterval[start])
            newInterval[end] = max(intervals[i][end], newInterval[end])
            i += 1

        # insert the new_interval
        merged.append(newInterval)

        # add all the remaining intervals to the output
        while i < len(intervals):
            merged.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1
        return merged
 ```
 
 Time complexity #
As we are iterating through all the intervals only once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals.
