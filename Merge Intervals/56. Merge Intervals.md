Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Solution from Leetcode

Method 1

Approach 1: Connected Components

Intuition

If we draw a graph (with intervals as nodes) that contains undirected edges between all pairs of intervals that overlap, then all intervals in each connected component of the graph can be merged into a single interval.

Algorithm

With the above intuition in mind, we can represent the graph as an adjacency list, inserting directed edges in both directions to simulate undirected edges. Then, to determine which connected component each node is it, we perform graph traversals from arbitrary unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited. To do this efficiently, we store visited nodes in a Set, allowing for constant time containment checks and insertion. Finally, we consider each connected component, merging all of its intervals by constructing a new Interval with start equal to the minimum start among them and end equal to the maximum end.

This algorithm is correct simply because it is basically the brute force solution. We compare every interval to every other interval, so we know exactly which intervals overlap. The reason for the connected component search is that two intervals may not directly overlap, but might overlap indirectly via a third interval. 

```ruby
class Solution:
    def overlap(self, a, b):
        return a[0] <= b[1] and b[0] <= a[1]

    # generate graph where there is an undirected edge between intervals u
    # and v iff u and v overlap.
    def build_graph(self, intervals):
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for i, interval_i in enumerate(intervals):
            for j in range(i+1, len(intervals)):
                if self.overlap(interval_i, intervals[j]):
                    graph[tuple(interval_i)].append(intervals[j])
                    graph[tuple(intervals[j])].append(interval_i)

        return graph

    # merges all of the nodes in this connected component into one interval.
    def merge_nodes(self, nodes):
        min_start = min(node[0] for node in nodes)
        max_end = max(node[1] for node in nodes)
        return [min_start, max_end]

    # gets the connected components of the interval overlap graph.
    def get_components(self, graph, intervals):
        visited = set()
        comp_number = 0
        nodes_in_comp = collections.defaultdict(list)

        def mark_component_dfs(start):
            stack = [start]
            while stack:
                node = tuple(stack.pop())
                if node not in visited:
                    visited.add(node)
                    nodes_in_comp[comp_number].append(node)
                    stack.extend(graph[node])

        # mark all nodes in the same connected component with the same integer.
        for interval in intervals:
            if tuple(interval) not in visited:
                mark_component_dfs(interval)
                comp_number += 1

        return nodes_in_comp, comp_number

    
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        graph = self.build_graph(intervals)
        nodes_in_comp, number_of_comps = self.get_components(graph, intervals)

        # all intervals in each connected component must be merged.
        return [self.merge_nodes(nodes_in_comp[comp]) for comp in range(number_of_comps)]
```

For instance, if the input is [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]], nodes_in_comp is defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {0: [(1, 3), (2, 6)], 1: [(8, 10)], 2: [(15, 18)]}).
