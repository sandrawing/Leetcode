Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Solution from Leetcode

Method 1

Approach 1: Connected Components

Intuition

If we draw a graph (with intervals as nodes) that contains undirected edges between all pairs of intervals that overlap, then all intervals in each connected component of the graph can be merged into a single interval.

Algorithm

With the above intuition in mind, we can represent the graph as an adjacency list, inserting directed edges in both directions to simulate undirected edges. Then, to determine which connected component each node is it, we perform graph traversals from arbitrary unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited. To do this efficiently, we store visited nodes in a Set, allowing for constant time containment checks and insertion. Finally, we consider each connected component, merging all of its intervals by constructing a new Interval with start equal to the minimum start among them and end equal to the maximum end.

This algorithm is correct simply because it is basically the brute force solution. We compare every interval to every other interval, so we know exactly which intervals overlap. The reason for the connected component search is that two intervals may not directly overlap, but might overlap indirectly via a third interval. 

```ruby
class Solution:
    def overlap(self, a, b):
        return a[0] <= b[1] and b[0] <= a[1]

    # generate graph where there is an undirected edge between intervals u
    # and v iff u and v overlap.
    def build_graph(self, intervals):
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for i, interval_i in enumerate(intervals):
            for j in range(i+1, len(intervals)):
                if self.overlap(interval_i, intervals[j]):
                    graph[tuple(interval_i)].append(intervals[j])
                    graph[tuple(intervals[j])].append(interval_i)

        return graph

    # merges all of the nodes in this connected component into one interval.
    def merge_nodes(self, nodes):
        min_start = min(node[0] for node in nodes)
        max_end = max(node[1] for node in nodes)
        return [min_start, max_end]

    # gets the connected components of the interval overlap graph.
    def get_components(self, graph, intervals):
        visited = set()
        comp_number = 0
        nodes_in_comp = collections.defaultdict(list)

        def mark_component_dfs(start):
            stack = [start]
            while stack:
                node = tuple(stack.pop())
                if node not in visited:
                    visited.add(node)
                    nodes_in_comp[comp_number].append(node)
                    stack.extend(graph[node])

        # mark all nodes in the same connected component with the same integer.
        for interval in intervals:
            if tuple(interval) not in visited:
                mark_component_dfs(interval)
                comp_number += 1

        return nodes_in_comp, comp_number

    
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        graph = self.build_graph(intervals)
        nodes_in_comp, number_of_comps = self.get_components(graph, intervals)

        # all intervals in each connected component must be merged.
        return [self.merge_nodes(nodes_in_comp[comp]) for comp in range(number_of_comps)]
```

For instance, if the input is [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]], nodes_in_comp is defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {0: [(1, 3), (2, 6)], 1: [(8, 10)], 2: [(15, 18)]}).


Approach 2: Sorting

```ruby
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        merged = []
        for interval in intervals:
            # if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            # interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
            # otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            # intervals.
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

        return merged
```

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(nlogn)

Other than the sort invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the O(nlgn)O(nlgn) complexity of sorting.

Space complexity : O(1) (or O(n))

If we can sort intervals in place, we do not need more than constant additional space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of intervals and sort that.

```ruby
from __future__ import print_function


class Interval:
  def __init__(self, start, end):
    self.start = start
    self.end = end

  def print_interval(self):
    print("[" + str(self.start) + ", " + str(self.end) + "]", end='')


def merge(intervals):
  if len(intervals) < 2:
    return intervals

  # sort the intervals on the start time
  intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)

  mergedIntervals = []
  start = intervals[0].start
  end = intervals[0].end
  for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
    interval = intervals[i]
    if interval.start <= end:  # overlapping intervals, adjust the 'end'
      end = max(interval.end, end)
    else:  # non-overlapping interval, add the previous internval and reset
      mergedIntervals.append(Interval(start, end))
      start = interval.start
      end = interval.end

  # add the last interval
  mergedIntervals.append(Interval(start, end))
  return mergedIntervals


def main():
  print("Merged intervals: ", end='')
  for i in merge([Interval(1, 4), Interval(2, 5), Interval(7, 9)]):
    i.print_interval()
  print()

  print("Merged intervals: ", end='')
  for i in merge([Interval(6, 7), Interval(2, 4), Interval(5, 9)]):
    i.print_interval()
  print()

  print("Merged intervals: ", end='')
  for i in merge([Interval(1, 4), Interval(2, 6), Interval(3, 5)]):
    i.print_interval()
  print()


main()
```

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N∗logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals. We are iterating the intervals only once which will take O(N), in the beginning though, since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take O(N∗logN).

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals. We will also need O(N) space for sorting. For Java, depending on its version, Collection.sort() either uses Merge sort or Timsort, and both these algorithms need O(N) space. Overall, our algorithm has a space complexity of O(N).
