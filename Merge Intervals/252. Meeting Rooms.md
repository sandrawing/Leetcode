Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), determine if a person could attend all meetings.

My solution

```ruby
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort(reverse=False)
        final = sum(intervals, [])
        final_sort = sorted(final)
        if final == final_sort:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Solution from Educative.io

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        start, end = 0, 1
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][start] < intervals[i-1][end]:
                return False
        return True
```

Time complexity : O(nlogn). The time complexity is dominated by sorting. Once the array has been sorted, only O(n)O(n) time is taken to go through the array and determine if there is any overlap.

Space complexity : O(1). Since no additional space is allocated.
