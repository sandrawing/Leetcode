Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence

Solution from Leetcode:

Approach 3: Dynamic Programming

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return len(nums)
        dp = [1]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            dp_curr = 0
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp_curr = max(dp_curr, dp[j])
            dp.append(dp_curr+1)
        return max(dp)
```

Time complexity : O(n^2). Two loops of nn are there.

Space complexity : O(n). dp array of size nn is used.
