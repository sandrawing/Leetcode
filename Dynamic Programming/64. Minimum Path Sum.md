Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

My solution

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp=[[0 for i in range(len(grid[0]))] for i in range(len(grid))] 
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        for i in range(1, len(grid[0])):
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + grid[0][i]
        for i in range(1, len(grid)):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
        for i in range(1, len(grid)):
            for j in range(1, len(grid[0])):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
