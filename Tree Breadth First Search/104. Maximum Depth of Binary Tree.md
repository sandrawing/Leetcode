Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

My solution

```ruby
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        level = 0
        queue = deque([root,])
        while queue:
            # number of elements in the current level 
            level_length = len(queue)
            
            for i in range(level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                # add child nodes of the current level
                # in the queue for the next level
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            # go to next level
            level += 1
        
        return level
```

Solution from Leetcode

Approach 1: Recursion

```ruby
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """ 
        if root is None: 
            return 0 
        else: 
            left_height = self.maxDepth(root.left) 
            right_height = self.maxDepth(root.right) 
            return max(left_height, right_height) + 1 
```

Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N), where NN is the number of nodes.

Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).
