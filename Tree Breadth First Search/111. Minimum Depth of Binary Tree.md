Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

My answer:

```ruby
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def minDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """    
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        level = 0
        queue = deque([root,])
        while queue:
            level += 1
            # number of elements in the current level 
            level_length = len(queue)
            
            for i in range(level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    return level
                
                # add child nodes of the current level
                # in the queue for the next level
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
 ```
 
Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
