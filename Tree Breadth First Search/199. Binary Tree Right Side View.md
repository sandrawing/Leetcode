Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

My solution

```ruby
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def rightSideView(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        levels = []
        if not root:
            return levels
        
        level = 0
        queue = deque([root,])
        while queue:
            # start the current level
            # number of elements in the current level 
            level_length = len(queue)
            
            for i in range(level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()
                # fulfill the current level
                if i == level_length - 1:
                    levels.append(node.val)
                
                # add child nodes of the current level
                # in the queue for the next level
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            # go to next level
            level += 1
        
        return levels
```

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
