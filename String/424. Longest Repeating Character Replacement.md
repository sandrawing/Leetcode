https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/

Given a string s that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

My solution

主要想法是 最大的长度 - k = 最大长度的这个slicing window里面出现的频率最高的字符的频率

当最高的频率 + k 比字符串的长度大的时候，start得开始往后移

```ruby
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        start = 0
        count = {}
        result = min(k, len(s))
        for end in range(len(s)):
            if s[end] in count:
                count[s[end]] += 1
            else:
                count[s[end]] = 1
            sum_len = sum(count.values())
            if sum_len <= max(count.values()) + k:
                result = max(result, sum_len)
            else:
                count[s[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
        return result
```

Solution from Educative.io

We’ll iterate through the string to add one letter at a time in the window. We’ll also keep track of the count of the maximum repeating 
letter in any window (let’s call it maxRepeatLetterCount). So at any time, we know that we can have a window which has one letter 
repeating maxRepeatLetterCount times, this means we should try to replace the remaining letters. If we have more than ‘k’ remaining
letters, we should shrink the window as we are not allowed to replace more than ‘k’ letters.

```ruby
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        window_start, max_length, max_repeat_letter_count = 0, 0, 0
        frequency_map = {}

        # Try to extend the range [window_start, window_end]
        for window_end in range(len(s)):
            right_char = s[window_end]
            if right_char not in frequency_map:
                frequency_map[right_char] = 0
            frequency_map[right_char] += 1
            max_repeat_letter_count = max(max_repeat_letter_count, frequency_map[right_char])
        
            # Current window size is from window_start to window_end, overall we have a letter which is
            # repeating 'max_repeat_letter_count' times, this means we can have a window which has one letter
            # repeating 'max_repeat_letter_count' times and the remaining letters we should replace.
            # if the remaining letters are more than 'k', it is the time to shrink the window as we
            # are not allowed to replace more than 'k' letters
            if (window_end - window_start + 1 - max_repeat_letter_count) > k:
                left_char = s[window_start]
                frequency_map[left_char] -= 1
                window_start += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
        return max_length
        return result
```
