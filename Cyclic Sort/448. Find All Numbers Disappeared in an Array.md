Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

My solution

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        i = 0
        result = []
        while i < len(nums):
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]  # swap
            else:
                i += 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i+1:
                result.append(i+1)
        return result
```

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n).

Space complexity #
Ignoring the space required for the output array, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
