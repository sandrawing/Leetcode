Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

My answer

```ruby
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        i = 0
        result = []
        while i < len(nums):
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]  # swap
            else:
                i += 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i+1:
                result.append(nums[i])
        return result
```
Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n).

Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1) but modifies the input array.
